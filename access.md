# Accessing the Cluster


* To attend the workshop you are getting Credentials to access jumphost.zwerk.org using SSH.
* Feel free to use VSCode with the remote-ssh Plugin to access jumphost.zwerk.org while still running and working with your graphical Editor
* If not you are going to use Vim oder Mcedit on the jumphost.
* I strongly recommend using tmux

# Gitrepository

All the examples are in a gitrepository so:

~~~
git clone https://github.com/erkules/k8sworkshop.git
cd k8sworkshop
~~~

From now on alle commands are expected to be executed from the `k8sworkshop` directory
